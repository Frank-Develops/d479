                <h2>Entertainment</h2>
                <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano.
                    However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered
                    fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a
                    microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an
                    arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by
                    next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing
                    area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. </p>
